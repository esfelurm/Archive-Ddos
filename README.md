## What is botnet? 

A botnet is a network of computers that is under the control of a person or group and uses them as intermediaries to carry out malicious activities without the knowledge of the owners of the computers. In fact, the various computers in the botnet are known as "bots" and are controlled by a controlled server. 

# Info

- In this section, you can see the botnets whose management panels are on the web 

- These types of botnets have a builder and most of them target Windows zombies

- These types of botnets are mostly in the form of web sockets (that is, they have a client file and a server file), which I'm sure you know better, so I won't give an explanation.

- <h4>What is IoT botnet? </h4>

- IoT botnets are networks created by hackers to control devices connected to the Internet of Things (IoT). These devices can include CCTV cameras, home routers, smart lighting systems and other devices. By taking advantage of security vulnerabilities in these devices, hackers connect them to their network and use them for their purposes such as DDoS attacks, espionage, and information theft. These networks have become one of the biggest security threats in the Internet world due to the high number of devices connected to the Internet of Things and the lack of attention to their security.
